                            <p>A podcast transcript is turned in to a small publishing house in Los Angeles. It turns out to be a piece of missing evidence in a murder investigation that ran cold. Take Fountain is the reprinting of that transcript, and only by reading the entire conversation can the murder be solved. </p>
                            <p>Take Fountain is a truly unique novel that slowly simmers to boil as an interview between two filmmakers gives hints to the anatomy of a brutal murder.
